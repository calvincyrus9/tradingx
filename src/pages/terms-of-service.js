          <p className="text-gray-300">
            Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis (&quot;Subscription(s)&quot;). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis (&quot;Billing Cycle&quot;). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Futuristic Trading cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team.

            Futuristic Trading may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (&quot;Free Trial&quot;).

            Futuristic Trading, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-300">
            Futuristic Trading will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.

            Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.
